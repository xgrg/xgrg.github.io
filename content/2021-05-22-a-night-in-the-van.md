Title: A Night in the Van

Some years ago at a time when traveling around the world was still a thing,
 we made this road trip around Iceland in a rented camper van. That trip was
 really memorable and would deserve so much more description. We enjoyed it so
 much that three months later we would buy a small van - a _Renault Kangoo Maxi_ -
  to convert it into our own camper. The construction process was a journey
  by itself as well. In the end it would have little to do with the fancy
  Volkswagen Westfalia but it would look like us, discrete and unpretentious.


For some time now the van has been exploring the European roads from Tarifa point
up to the North Cape. It even had its tiny share of public coverage

Since the beginning we kept a tradition consisting in recording in a notebook
every night spent in the van. Just a few words capturing the place and the
general atmosphere. Seven years later the tradition still goes on and
I thought I would pick some random entries and post them here.

## Night #1:

<div style="padding:20px; text-align:justify; background-color:#50453e; color:white">
First night onboard: Mittlach (Vosges, France) - on the way to the camping area - rainy weather.
</div>

_How did I ended in the Vosges for my first night? I wanted some
mountains, the closest possible to Paris and on top of this I had never been
in that area._

## Night #2:

<div style="padding:20px; text-align:justify; background-color:#50453e; color:white">
Close to Lac Noir (Orbey, Vosges) - calm - in the morning I went for a jogging
in the surrounding mountains.
</div>

## Night #34:

<div style="padding:20px; text-align:justify; background-color:#50453e; color:white">
Prize for the most adventurous 4x4 Kangoo trick. Along the road 7 heading for Bergen, going across mountains split between lakes and tundra-style short vegetation. On one side of the road, some non-drivable slope leads to some flat area, where the Kangoo will spend a peaceful night under heavy rain. But scary moment going down back on the road! Had to go out at night to the bathroom under the rain.
