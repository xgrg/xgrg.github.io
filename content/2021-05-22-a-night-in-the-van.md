Title: A Night in the Van

Some years ago at a time when traveling around the world was still a thing,
 we made this road trip around Iceland in a rented camper van. That trip was
 really memorable and would deserve so much more description. We enjoyed it so
 much that three months later we would buy a small van - a _Renault Kangoo Maxi_ -
  to convert it into our own camper. The construction process was a journey
  by itself as well. In the end it would have little to do with the fancy
  Volkswagen Westfalia but it would look like us, unpretentious and discrete.


Since the beginning we started a tradition consisting in recording in a notebook
every night spent in the van. Just a few words capturing the place and the
general atmosphere. Seven years later the tradition still goes on and
I thought I would pick some random entries and post them here.

## Night #1:

First night onboard: Mittlach (Vosges, France) - on the way to the camping area - rainy wheather.
</div>

## Night #2:

<div style="padding:20px; text-align:justify; background-color:#50453e; color:white">
Close to Lac Noir (Orbey, Vosges) - calm - in the morning I went for a jogging
in the surrounding mountains.
