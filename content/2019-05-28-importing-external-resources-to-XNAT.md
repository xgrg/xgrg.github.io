Title: Importing external resources to XNAT

We tend to give general preference to data coming from local "_XNAT-native_"
 workflows. Yet sometimes some factors (e.g. related to computational power,
   software availability) may require us to import resources from external,
   less controlled, data sources.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This example shows how to get external archives imported to an XNAT instance
as additional resources to MR experiments. In this present case these archives
will consist of FreeSurfer outputs.

### Step 1: prepare archive files with the resources to be imported

FreeSurfer `recon-all` outputs generally follow a standard file organization
under a parent folder named after the subject (stored in the `SUBJECTS_DIR` root
 folder). In this example, we first create a ZIP file for every subject at the
 level of their corresponding individual folder.

> For each subject:
> `cd $SUBJECTS_DIR; zip -r $SUBJECTNAME_FREESURFER6.zip $SUBJECTNAME`

The ZIP file will contain one single folder (carrying the subject's ID) which
will contain the usual FreeSurfer folders (`mri`, `stats`, `scripts`, etc.).

For the next step we will need a Python dictionary `zipfiles` giving for every
subject the path to the corresponding ZIP file.

Example:
```
zipfiles = {'subject01': '/path/to/subject01_FREESURFER6.zip'}
```

### Step 2: create blank project/subjects/experiments and assign resources

In case the subjects/experiments already exist, the following code will need to
be adapted with proper values for variables `subjects` and `experiments`.

```python
from pyxnat import Interface

config_file = '/home/grg/.xnat_bsc.cfg'
subjects = ['subject01', 'subject02', 'subject03']
project = 'MY_PROJECT'

# setup an XNAT connection
c = Interface(config=config_file)
p = c.select.project(project)
p.create()
experiments = {}

# create subjects
for subject in subjects:
   s = p.subject(subject)
   s.create()
   e = s.experiment('%s_MR1'%subject) # experiment will be named after subject
   e.create()

   r = e.resource('FREESURFER6')
   zipfile = zipfiles[subject] # needs to be previously built
   r.put_zip(zipfile, format=None, content=None, tags=None)

c.disconnect()
```
