<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Analyses based on Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) focus
 on a number of parcels with homogeneous characteristics, which are generally
 related to brain structures. This type of analysis is rather popular in neuroimaging
 especially when the study builds onto some hypothesis precisely related to
 some of these brain structures.

 Two approaches are generally available, as two opposite ways of addressing anatomical variability.

  - One way consists in warping all the subjects to a common
reference space and using ROIs defined from a brain atlas.
  - The other one consists in delineating ROIs individually in every subject,
  e.g., using segmentation algorithms.  Resulting objects are likely to be closer
  to the individual anatomical truth, therefore improving sensitivity by focusing on
  the signal of interest, as compared to voxel-based methods.

ROIs are thus often defined over anatomical data and then used to filter the
 signal from other image modalities.

##  Collecting mean values from atlas regions

In this example, we generate some maps (N=50) with some random values over an
MNI brain mask. They will be like our individual (subject-level) maps.  

Regions-of-interest will be defined over these simulated maps and descriptive values will be
extracted from these regions. Real images may be used instead (provided they
  are in the same reference space).

#### Generating random maps (optional)

This [gist](https://gist.github.com/xgrg/3405bbe95f6aa589ac5dfbfb9843c73f)
shows the documented execution of this part.

```python
import tempfile
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn import image
import numpy as np
images = []

atlas = datasets.load_mni152_brain_mask()

# Generate 50 random maps
for i in range(0, 50):
    d = np.random.rand(*atlas.dataobj.shape) * atlas.dataobj
    im = image.new_img_like(atlas, d)
    im = image.smooth_img(im, 5)
    _, f = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.nii.gz')
    im.to_filename(f)
    images.append(f)

from nilearn import plotting as npl
name = 'cort-maxprob-thr50-2mm'
atlas_fp = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford(name)['maps']

for each in images[:3]:
    npl.plot_roi(atlas_fp, bg_img=each)
```

#### Collecting the ROI values

`roistats.collect` module has a function `roistats_from_maps(images, atlas_fp)`
which takes a set (`images`) of images (their file paths) and `atlas_fp`, the
 path to a *ROI volume* (i.e. a volume with integer labels defining areas of
   interest [and 0 elsewhere]). All images should be coregistered in the same
   space (e.g. MNI). The ROI volume may thus come from an atlas, as the ones
   from the [`nilearn.datasets`](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.datasets)
  module.


```python
from roistats import collect
import numpy as np

# Here we collect the mean value from each ROI on every image
res = collect.roistats_from_maps(images, atlas_fp,
                                 func=np.mean,
                                 subjects=images,
                                 n_jobs=8)
```

The created table will have as many columns as there are ROI labels.
We may rename them with the corresponding names from the atlas.

```python
# Get label names from Harvard Oxford atlas
from nilearn import datasets

name = 'cort-maxprob-thr50-2mm'
labels = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford(name)['labels']

# Store them in a dict
labels = dict(enumerate(labels))
```



```python
df = df.rename(columns=labels)
```

## Plotting the data

`roistats` comes with a module `plotting` intended for visualizing tabular data
(built on top of [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)/[`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/))
with some predefined functions for boxplots, scatter plots with linear model fits
or histograms, with the possibility to account for covariates (using
  inline linear regressions). The same function hence takes the data, computes
  some version corrected for given covariates and plots it in some different possible
  ways.


To recreate some kind of realistic case, let us add some totally random
covariates to these previously extracted ROI values. Random "group", random age,
random sex,
random [APOE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E) E4 status.


```python
# Let us add some totally random covariates

df['group'] = df.index
df['group'] = df.apply (lambda row: int(row['group'] > len(df)/2) + 1, axis=1)
df['age'] = df.apply (lambda row: random.random() * 5 + 50, axis=1)
df['sex'] = df.apply (lambda row: random.choice(['male', 'female']), axis=1)
df['apoee4'] = df.apply (lambda row: random.choice(['HO', 'HT', 'NC']), axis=1)
df['index'] = df.index

# How do they look
covariates = ['group', 'age', 'sex', 'apoee4']
df[covariates].head()

```

|   | group | age       | sex    | apoee4 |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 1     | 53.620190 | female | NC     |
| 1 | 1     | 53.531222 | female | NC     |
| 2 | 1     | 51.073742 | female | NC     |
| 3 | 1     | 54.184375 | male   | HT     |
| 4 | 1     | 52.552064 | female | HT     |

We will now plot the mean values from any given region (say the [temporal pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temporal_pole) but could be any other one). Importantly, we
want to account for the potential influence of the covariates we just added (e.g.
  differences between men/women, effect of age, influence of APOE status).

For instance, let us look at the effect of the APOE status on the mean intensities
taken in the Temporal Pole (across these 50 maps), accounting for the effect of age,
sex and "group".

`plotting` has a method called `boxplot` for this.

```python
from roistats import plotting
region = 'Temporal Pole'

# Plot data from this region
# Do it *accounting for covariates*
_ = plotting.boxplot(region, data=df, by='apoee4',
                     covariates=['age', 'sex', 'group'],
                     palette='default')
```

![boxplot1](/images/roi/boxplot1.png)

The plot displays the p values of two-sample t tests between each pair of
categories, here APOE groups. No significant difference is found in any case
(which makes sense considering the data comes from the same random process).

Same thing now with sex differences.

```python
# Now by sex
_ = plotting.boxplot(region, data=df, by='sex',
                     covariates=['age', 'group'],
                     palette='default')
```

![boxplot2](/images/roi/boxplot2.png)

Still no significant difference.

Let us now look at age x APOE interaction, corrected for sex and "group".

`plotting` has a method called `lmplot` for this.

```python
_ = plotting.lmplot(y=region, x='age', data=df,
                    order=1,
                    covariates=['sex', 'group'],
                    hue='apoee4',
                    palette='default',
                    s=50)
```


![lmplot](/images/roi/lmplot.png)

For the last example, the table needs to be reshaped a bit ("unpivot"). This is
done to allow the use of large tables with many rows (and a moderate number of columns).

```python
# For this last one reshape the table a bit ("unpivot")
cov = df[['age', 'apoee4', 'sex']]
melt = pd.melt(df, id_vars='index',
               value_vars=labels.values(),
               var_name='region').set_index('index')
melt = melt.join(cov)
```

It would look like this:

```python
# Only keep 5 regions for this example
regions = list(set(melt['region']))
melt = melt[melt['region'].isin(regions[10:15])]

# It looks like this
melt.head()
```

|   | region                                    | value    | age      | apoee4 | sex    |
|---|-------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Inferior Frontal Gyrus, pars triangularis | 0.458292 | 53.62019 | NC     | female |
| 0 | Superior Parietal Lobule                  | 0.508143 | 53.62019 | NC     | female |
| 0 | Frontal Orbital Cortex                    | 0.480872 | 53.62019 | NC     | female |
| 0 | Central Opercular Cortex                  | 0.496808 | 53.62019 | NC     | female |
| 0 | Supracalcarine Cortex                     | 0.487534 | 53.62019 | NC     | female |


`roistats.plotting` has a method called `hist` to represent all the ROIs on a
single plot.

In this example, APOE status would be considered as the effect of interest,
and age and sex as covariates.

```python
_ = plotting.hist(melt, by='apoee4',
                  region_colname='region',
                  covariates=['age', 'sex'],
                  ylim=[0.45, 0.55],
                  aspect=2,
                  palette='default')
```


![hist1](/images/roi/hist1.png)


Now same thing with sex differences, correcting for age and APOE status.

```python
# Again by sex
_ = plotting.hist(melt, by='sex',
                  region_colname='region',
                  covariates=['age', 'apoee4'],
                  ylim=[0.45, 0.55],
                  aspect=2,
                  palette='default')
```

For the context, I was working with diffusion-weighted imaging and myelin content
to study the effect of age, sex and the APOE gene on microstructural properties
of the white matter when I started to write this code.

This led to these two publications:
